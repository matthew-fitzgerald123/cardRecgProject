# cardRecognition
card recognition project **(Work in Progress)**

I set out to gather and procure a dataset that I could use to train a neural network that I created to recognize different playing cards.

This was my first time creating and training a model.

**Steps:**
1. Created a dataset from images of playing cards that I had taken.
2. Performed augmentations on the dataset to greatly expand it.
3. Trained a neural network from the expanded dataset.
4. Created a script that used the model to recognize cards from camera input.

There's much more work to be done, but this was done in about an hour's time.

**Libraries Used:**
Numpy, Tensorflow, PIL, CV2, IMGAUG
